# Auto Layout 

## What you will create

Here we have developed an Dice Rolling app.
Although Dicee is already pretty dicey, we get into problems when we try to rotate the screen to landscape or if we have a screen size that is not the same as the canvas. So, we have also fixed this problem and made it using Auto Layout.

## What you will learn

* How to add constraints and understanding how Auto Layout works.
* How to Pin and Align elements.
* How to create containers to configure advanced layouts.
* How to debug auto layout errors.
* Understanding what Xcode needs in order to correctly layout a design.
* How to use Stack Views to create complex interfaces.
